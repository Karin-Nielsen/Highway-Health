OpenWeatherMaps:
Trendata suggesting using minute forecast 1 hour? Perhaps along with the current weather.
Could be useful for safety bc the most dangerous times re: weather on the road is 20 minutes before impactful weather.

Historical Data: 
Per Chris 4/1/2022: Definitely build historical database with our API responses.
Build with local databases.

Mayor is interested in Richardson data. 
Might be able to get us more data to play with.
Currently working with comprehensive New Mexico road data.


-----------

4/3/2022

- Successful import of json road data via Python
- Also successfully storing road: Name, Type, Lat/Lon into a local DB I've created via MySQL in Python.
- Tested OpenWeatherMaps API with random Lat/Lon info from this dataset, returns valid json.

-----------

4/6/2022

- Working on getting lat/long successfully stored into a dictionary so I can save into the database

-----------

4/7/2022

- Dictionaries successfully created (one with hwy name/type and one with lat/long)
- Moved different functions into their own classes/modules to make createDB/tables & insert into DB + other items separated
- I will move from OpenWeatherMaps to Here Weather bc it appears to be able to do most things the same
- json data has been fully manipulated for insertion into DB
- DB insertion is now functional

-----------

4/8/2022

- All python scripts are cleaned up and commented appropriately. 
- started working with Here API. Bootstrapping using with Python via https://herepy.abdullahselek.com/ (pip install herepy)
- herepy does not function well; attempting manual solution
- found pricing for HERE weather: we may want to stick with OpenWeatherMaps after all...will stop working on this until 
    further discussion with group.
- Starting to look for a smaller dataset (city only if possible); the size of the NM state requests is pretty huge.

4/15/2022

- Modified dataset manipulation script for reading in Richardson, TX dataset. Merging changes with main.
- OpenWeatherMaps works fine. HERE Destination Weather API via HerePy is not working for some reason. Reached out to Musa for help if possible.
- Saving API results to json file / CSV file
- Considering design for saving historical data to a database

-----------

4/16/2022

- Update API results to better describe weather conditions. 
- Write/update a Weather Data Analysis document to descibe what the results from the OpenWeatherMaps api calls mean
- Work on a document that determines math for how often we can call from OpenWeatherMaps, depending on plan/request types
- Updated code to test approximately 50 api calls at once (1 call/second), works perfectly
- Added CST timezone to the date/time result on the API call. Should help us with historical data
- Start planning how to store results into a database as well as the csv/json files
