OpenWeatherMaps:
Trendata suggesting using minute forecast 1 hour? Perhaps along with the current weather.
Could be useful for safety bc the most dangerous times re: weather on the road is 20 minutes before impactful weather.

Historical Data: 
Trendata implies we should keep track of our historical data via database. This is in my WHEELHOUSE.

Mayor is interested in Richardson data bc obviously he is. Might be able to get us more data to play with.
